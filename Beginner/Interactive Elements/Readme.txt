Project Goal:

Your objective is to develop a webpage with at least three interactive elements. These elements should exhibit different behaviors based on user interaction - mouseover, click, or form submission.

Interactive Element Ideas:

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Color Changing Text: Create a text element that changes color when the user hovers their mouse over it (mouseover event). Let it change back to the original color when the mouse leaves (mouseout event).

Image Swap: Display an image on the page. When the user clicks on the image (click event), swap it with another image.

Interactive Quote Box: Design a quote box with a quote and an author's name. When the user submits a form with new quote and author details (form submission event), update the quote box with the new information.

Step-by-Step Guide:

Setting Up the HTML Structure:

Create a basic HTML file (e.g., index.html) with the necessary structure for your webpage.
Include elements like <div>, <p>, <img>, and <form> to construct your interactive sections.
Assign unique IDs to the elements that will be manipulated using JavaScript (e.g., <p id="text-element">).
Adding JavaScript Code:

Create a <script> tag within your HTML file or link a separate JavaScript file (.js) to your HTML.
Inside the <script> tag, write your JavaScript code to handle user interactions with the elements.
Event Listeners:

Use JavaScript's addEventListener method to attach event listeners to your targeted elements.
Specify the type of event you want to listen for (e.g., "mouseover", "click", "submit").
Define a function that will be executed when the specific event occurs on the element.
DOM Manipulation:

Inside the event listener function, use methods like getElementById, textContent, and src (for images) to access and modify the content or attributes of the targeted element.
